# Stanford Machine Learning Solution Set Week 5

#### Details

Implementation (in Octave) of the backpropagation algorithm for neural networks.
The file ex3data1.mat contains 5000 training examples where each example 
is 20x20 pixel grayscale image of a digit (i.e. MNIST dataset)

For solutions to the assignment check out the following;
```
  sigmoidGradient.m
  randInitializeWeights.m
  nnCostFunction.m
```
