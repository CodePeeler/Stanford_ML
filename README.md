# Stanford - Machine Learning

My solutions (in Octave) to some of the more challenging assignment from [Andrew Ng's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng) Machine Learning Course.

This course has been retired (*so I see no harm in sharing these solutions*). 
The new extended and revised course available through [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) will be offered in python.
